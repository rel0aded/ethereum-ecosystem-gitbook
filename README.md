# The Ethereum Ecosystem Guide

The Ethereum ecosystem is constantly growing, especially since "DeFi Summer" occurred in 2020. Since that time, new projects come online daily - and that rate has only multiple since Layer 2 chains have started to be activated.

This guide aims to summarize the projects deployed to the various Ethereum networks to serve as background into the expotential innovation occurring within the ecosystem, attempting to provide a single location to keep up with the developments and releases that are constantly happening.

## Disclaimer

This content attempts to document the various projects live on the Ethereum network. It makes no promises about the security or legitimancy of those projects. Every effort has been made to only include valid projects; however, the author has not performed their own code audit, nor required third-party proof of such an audit before permitting the inclusion of a project on this site.

Inclusion of a project within this documentation is not an advocation to the use of the accompanying contracts, website or application, nor a recommendation to purchase the governance tokens associated with the project.
