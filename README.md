# The Ethereum Ecosystem Guide

The Ethereum ecosystem is constantly growing, especially since "DeFi Summer" occurred in 2020. Since that time, new projects come online daily - and that rate has only multiplied since Layer 2 chains have started to be activated.

The goal of this site is:

- To summarize, as simply as possible, the legitimate projects deployed to the various Ethereum networks
- To explain some of the vital concepts that these applications build upon
- To serve as an introduction into the constant innovation occurring within the DeFi ecosystem
