# The Ethereum Ecosystem Guide

The Ethereum ecosystem is constantly growing, especially since "DeFi Summer" occurred in 2020. Since that time, new projects come online daily - and that rate has only multiplied since Layer 2 chains have started to be activated.

This guide aims to summarize the projects deployed to the various Ethereum networks to serve as background into the expotential innovation occurring within the ecosystem, attempting to provide a single location to keep up with the developments and releases that are constantly happening.
