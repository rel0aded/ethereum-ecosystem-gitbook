# Ethereum

Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain that includes the ability to execute smart contracts and was initially envisioned by Vitalik Buterin. Ongoing development of the protocol is now primarily directed by the "Core Developers", with a number of client teams creating their own implementations of the protocol specifications into their applications.
