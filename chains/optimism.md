# Optimism

Optimism is a optimistic rollup Layer 2 built by Optimism PBC. [It was fully released on 16th December, 2021.](https://optimismpbc.medium.com/all-gas-no-brakes-8b0f32afd466) The chain is described as "EVM equivalent", with transaction fees for gas made using ETH.

Due to being an optimistic rollup, withdrawing assets from the L2 back to the Ethereum mainnet through the official Optimism Gateway incurs a 7-day delay to give verifiers sufficient time to complete their fraud checks. This delay can be bypassed by using a bridge provided by a third-party, who take on the risk that the withdrawal is not valid through an additional fee on the user.
