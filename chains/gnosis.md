# Gnosis

Gnosis Chain (formally xDAI) is an Ethereum sidechain designed for fast and cheap transactions. It was formed when GnosisDAO merged with the xDAI network in late 2021.

The base token of the network is xDAI, which is priced at a 1:1 peg of Ethereum $DAI (issued by [MakerDAO's Oasis Borrow application](/projects/maker-oasis-borrow)) by the locking the funds on the mainnet blockchain.

The POAP project issues their tokens on this chain, rather than the more-expensive Ethereum chain; however, POAP recipients have the option to bridge their tokens onto the mainnet if they desire.
