# Polygon

The Polygon (originally Matic) network is a decentralized Proof of Stake sidechain that was released on 15th May, 2020. The chain is EVM-compatible, with transaction fees for gas made using the MATIC token.

As a sidechain, bridging from Polygon back to the Ethereum mainnet does not incur the same withdrawal delay as the [Arbitrum One](arbitrum-one.md) and [Optimism](optimism.md) optimistic rollups.
