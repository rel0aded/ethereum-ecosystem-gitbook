# Arbitrum One

Arbitrum One is a optimistic rollup Layer 2 built by Offchain Labs. [It was fully released on 31st August, 2021.](https://offchain.medium.com/mainnet-for-everyone-27ce0f67c85e) The chain is EVM-compatible, with transaction fees for gas made using ETH.

Due to being an optimistic rollup, withdrawing assets from the L2 back to the Ethereum mainnet through the official Arbitrum Bridge incurs a 7-day delay to give verifiers sufficient time to complete their fraud checks. This delay can be bypassed by using a bridge provided by a third-party, who take on the risk that the withdrawal is not valid through an additional fee on the user.
