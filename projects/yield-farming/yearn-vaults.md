# Yearn Vaults

Yearn Vaults are a [yield farming](/concepts/yield-farming.md) implementation, using various in-house strategies to try to maximise the yield returned to their users.

They support a very large number of different token pairs, and make use of smart contracts from other protocols in order to achieve the income. Users pay a 2% annual management fee, and a 20% performance fee on their returns.

## Chains

Yearn Vaults are currently deployed to the following chains:

- Ethereum
- Arbitrum (February 2022)
