# Rocket Pool

Rocket Pool is a decentralized staking solution which seeks to allow individuals to get involved trustlessly with Etherum Proof of Stake (PoS) and the Beaconchain network.

Node operators can start a validator using 16 $ETH + (a minumum of) 1.6 ETH's worth of $RPL. This is paired with an additional 16 ETH from a pool of deposits from non-operators (which has minimum deposit 0.1 $ETH). Through the use of smart contracts to prevent the theft of these additional funds, the operator is able to use the 32 $ETH to begin staking, sharing the proceeds (minus a 15% fee) back to the users who deposited into the pool.

## Chains

The Rocket Pool is currently deployed to the following chains:
