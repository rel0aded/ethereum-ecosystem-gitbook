# LooksRare

LooksRare is an NFT marketplace that allows users to list, buy and sell their non-fungible tokens directly to other blockchain users.

The site allows holders and potential buyers to see the traits of a given NFT, determine how rare those traits are, and view the ownership history throughout its life.

Unlike OpenSea, LooksRare also allow "collection bids" to be submitted against a particular NFT set. These apply to every NFT in the collection, and can be accepted by any owner for the buyer's proposed price, consuming the bid.

## Chains

LooksRare is currently deployed to the following chains:
