# Matcha

Matcha is a decentralized [exchange aggregator](/concepts/exchange-aggregator.md). The system attempts to maximise a user's swap between two assets, in order to return to them the highest possible number of their target token by comparing a number of decentralized exchanges for the best trade, and then performing this action for the user.

## Chains

Matcha is currently deployed to the following chains:

- Ethereum
- Polygon (June 2021)
- Optimism (January 2022)
