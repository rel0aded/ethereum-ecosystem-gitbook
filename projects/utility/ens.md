# ENS

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a method to allow Ethereum addresses to be referred to using human-readable or memorable names, such as a word or set of words.

These names, called domains, function in the same way as domain names on the traditional Internet; in this case however, the name resolves to a wallet address, rather than an IP address. The system is implemented by creating an NFT and sending this to the holder of a given domain. This can be the address of a particular user's wallet, or even a smart contract. This method allows the ENS to be bought and sold on secondary NFT markets.

ENS names can also point to IPFS resources, allowing the hosting of decentralised websites through specially-configured web browsers.

## Chains

The ENS protocol is currently deployed to the following chains:

- Ethereum

This means that ENS registrations can only occur on the Ethereum mainnet chain.

However, protocols and chains are responsible for implementing support for these readable addresses. Not all mainnet applications support their use, and some Layer 2 protocols may provide a method to lookup the corresponding address, even though ENS do not provide a method to do this themselves.
