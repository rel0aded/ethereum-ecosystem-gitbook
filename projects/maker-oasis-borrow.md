# Oasis Borrow

Oasis Borrow is an application from Maker to create a decentralized, USD-pegged stablecoin ($DAI) debt backed by various cryptocurrency assets deposited into the application contract.

A user can borrow up to 66% of the value of their deposited $ETH (or other currency as approved by MakerDAO, at various ratios) as $DAI. The liqudation price for this loan is then set based on the percentage borrowed against the deposited assets, which will be sold on the open market if the price drops below this value in order to satisfy the debt.

$DAI is a common asset supported by a large number of other applications; but all $DAI that exists across the whole Ethereum ecosystem has been generated by locking other assets into this contract.
