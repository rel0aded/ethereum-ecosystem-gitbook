# Automated Market Maker (AMM)

An Automated Market Maker (AMM) is a collection of smart contracts that make use of deposits previously made into a liquidity pool to allow trades between tokens without needing to maintain an order book. An AMM with remaining liquidity will always be available to serve as the second side to a user's desired trade, with the price charged to the user dynamically changing as the available liquidity in the pool increases or decreases through swaps occurring.

Using an AMM allows for a user to immediately swap between ETH and an ERC-20 token, or between two ERC-20 tokens, without needing to wait for a second user on the Ethereum to be awake and available to accept the terms of the trade.
