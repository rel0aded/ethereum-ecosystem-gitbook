# Decentralized Exchange (DEX)

A decentralized exchange (DEX) exists as smart contract computer code stored on a blockchain, and can be interacted with using wallet addresses on that chain.

A DEX does not require its users to complete "Know Your Customer" (KYC) verification; wallet owners are able to call the methods of the DEX themselves and swap between two on-chain assets without needing to use an intermediary, or trust a third-party with their funds.
