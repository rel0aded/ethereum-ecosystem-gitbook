# Yield Farming

Many Liquidity Pool applications issue their own token to the users who have provided the assets used in the pool. Yield farming takes these tokens and attempts to gain a higher return than just the fees earned from providing the pool liquidity, such as periodcally selling these tokens back into the assets originally deposited (and then also depositing those new assets too), or staking those emitted tokens in various contracts in order to earn more returns.
