## Disclaimer

This content attempts to document the various projects live on the Ethereum network. It makes no promises about the security or legitimancy of those projects. Every effort has been made to only include valid projects; however, the author has not performed their own code audit, nor required third-party proof of such an audit before permitting the inclusion of a project on this site.

Inclusion of a project within this documentation is not an advocation to the use of the accompanying contracts, website or application, nor a recommendation to purchase the governance tokens associated with the project.
